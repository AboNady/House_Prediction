    Most of the work was data preprocessing, filtring and cleaning.
I tried 3 different regression algorithms, Linear Regression, RandomForest amd XGBoost.
and the score and the Mean Square Error were the following:

## Tech Stack

* **Python:** Version 3.10

* **Scikit-Learn**: Version 1.1.2

* **Pandas**: Version 1.4.3


## Details

* Feature engineering was the best thing I learned in this project; I dropped the nan columns because they were misleading for the classification algorithm. Then I replaced the nan values with the coulmn's mean.


* I splitted the dataset to 70% Train and 30% Test.

* I tried 3 different regression algorithms and the results was as following:

---------------------------------------
Linear Reg
0.8233656237553196
RMSE :  0.048385
---------------------------------------
Random Forest
0.8443752818314662
RMSE :  0.045416
---------------------------------------
XGB Reg
0.8502656831659069
RMSE :  0.044549
---------------------------------------
